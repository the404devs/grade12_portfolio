					The world of computers can be complex and dangerous at times, from online attacks to the legal web surrounding the sharing and modifying of classic games. Computers, however, can work to make the world a better place, such as with an application enabling a user to snap a picture of an object and instantly learn whether or not they can recycle it. Computers, and technology in general is advancing at a rapid pace, and our society needs to evolve with it. As driverless cars begin to dominate the streets, proper protocols need to be in place to make sure that an outside attacker cannot gain control of a vehicle. To ensure our new technology is safe, we need young students to learn about Computer Science, and enter the workforce ready to develop the software of tomorrow. To be successful, these students will need to follow a few simple ergonomic tips to ensure they aren't creating the future at the expense of their own bodies.
