					As the years pass, our society becomes more and more technological. Even a decade ago, driverless cars seemed like something out of <i>The Jetsons,</i> yet within another decade, they will likely be the new norm. As this technology comes into the light of society, it will inevitably be adapted for other purposes. This article talks about the possibility of police forces using driverless cars to catch traffic violators on the road. Ford, the car company, is exploring this possibility, and says that some routine tasks for police officers, such as issuing tickets, could be automated and carried out by artificial intelligence. However, the need to police the roads is not going to last forever. Once society transitions fully to driverless cars, the number of traffic violations at a human's fault would drop to nearly zero.
